          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moradabad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moradabad</a> on the birthday of a <a href="https://www.hinduamerican.org/ram-navami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hindu deity</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            A series of wonderful and unique moments has shaped my life since.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            Early on, I fell, upside down, off my home's balcony. However, I just fractured my legs and broke my femur. For a while, not walking again was a real possibility. But I managed to walk again and, even, run faster. Strangely, the accident also improved my stamina and long-distance running.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            For 7 years, I attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_College,_Mussoorie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">St. George's College</a>, a boarding school, located in a hill station named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussoorie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mussoorie</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            During that period, I got heavily involved in Table Tennis and Quizzing. I made it to nationals and states for 5 years in both fields, winning numerous awards. The most fun I had was in quizzing on National Television for 2 consecutive seasons at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Sports_Quiz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">USQ</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            What makes that funnier is that the school barely gave us internet access, and personal electronics were not a thing (I did sneak in a phone during my last year there, though, subjecting myself to a potential $1500 fine. They couldn't catch me).
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            In 2023, I scored 98.6%, the highest % in the institute's 66-year-old history, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ICSE</a> grade 10 examinations. I was in the top 10 in my state and likely in the top 100 in the country. Thanks to my phone!
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            2 months into the junior year of high school, I decided to leave the place because of a few things that had radicalised me. Forever grateful to Parv, Sidhant, Ashesh, Soham, and Shaurya for being there since Day 1 and still being there!
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            In the 2 years that followed, I completed my high school studies in a local school in Moradabad. My participation was minimal, and I mostly self-studied and earned some bucks.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I did marketing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell%27s_Old_Boys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Newell's Old Boys</a>, an International football club, competed internationally in <a href="https://www.naqt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NAQT tournaments</a>, went viral on <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/twitter/most-viewed-videos-on-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Football Twitter</a>, featured on ESPN, stood Top 100/10M+ players in <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FPL</a>, did marketing research with <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/shuny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shun Yiu</a>, studied for a few olympiads, lead a state NGO, fundraised over $25,000, and worked on issues surrounding sustainability, access to high-quality education, and improving employment rates in the city (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/uttar-pradesh-city-moradabad-is-world-s-2nd-noisiest-city-delhi-kolkata-also-on-un-noise-pollution-list-101648348708558.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which is one of the most polluted and noisiest in the world</a>).

            Interactions with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esatbayar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Esat Bayar</a> convinced me to apply to study abroad and helped me realise what I wish to do in the future.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            For now, I am at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bocconi University</a> and <a href="https://www.hec.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HEC Paris</a>, taking courses in Data Science, Government and History (I, still, mostly self-study). Being a first-generation student, I am very grateful to my Mom and Dad for giving me this opportunity.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I am a bit of a sybarite and adore the top-tier material world. Also like eating nachos, playing pickleball, <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/286820/track-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">forecasting the future</a>, cooking for and travelling with the people I love.

                <p>Nordic countries and Nordics are so, so cool! Got flown out to Stockholm and created a blockchain powered digital executor that detects when someone passes away and securely transfers technical access to their digital assets (royalties, crypto, subscriptions, NFTs, accounts) to their beneficiaries. It bypasses the "MFA deadlock" (2FA, biometrics, locked devices) through continuous liveness verification and encrypted key orchestration.</p>
