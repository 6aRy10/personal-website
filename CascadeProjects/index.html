            Hi, I'm <a href="./Screenshot 2026-02-20 205348.png">Ayush</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moradabad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moradabad</a> on the birthday of a <a href="https://www.hinduamerican.org/ram-navami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hindu deity</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            A series of wonderful and unique moments has shaped my life since.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            Early on, I fell, upside down, off my home's balcony. However, I just fractured my legs and broke my femur. For a while, not walking again was a real possibility. But I managed to walk again and, even, run faster. Strangely, the accident also improved my stamina and long-distance running.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            For 7 years, I attended <a href="https://www.stgeorgescollege.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">St. George's College</a>, a boarding school, located in a hill station named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussoorie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mussoorie</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            During this time, I got heavily involved in Table Tennis and Quizzing. I made it to nationals and states for 5 years in both fields, winning numerous awards. The most notable ones included quizzing on National Television for 2 consecutive seasons, finishing in the Top 36/4000 teams at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Sports_Quiz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">USQ</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            What makes that funnier is that the school barely gave us internet access, and personal electronics were basically not a thing (I did sneak in a phone for my last year in the school, though, subjecting myself to a potential 1500 euro fine. They couldn't catch me).
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            In 2023, I scored 98.6%, the highest % in my school's 66-year-old history, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ICSE</a> grade 10 examinations. I was top 10 in my state and likely top 100 in the country. Thanks to my phone!
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            2 months into the junior year of high school, I decided to leave the place because of a few things that had radicalised me. Forever grateful to Parv, Sidhant, Ashesh, Soham, and Shaurya for being there since Day 1 and still being there!
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            In the 2 years that followed, I completed my high school studies in a local school in Moradabad. My attendance rate was tittle, and I mostly self-studied and earned some bucks.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I did marketing for an Argentine club, named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell%27s_Old_Boys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Newell's Old Boys</a>, went viral on <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/twitter/most-viewed-videos-on-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Football Twitter</a>, featured on ESPN, finished Top 100/ 10M+ players in FPL, conducted research on marketing with <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/shuny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shun Yiu</a>, studied for a few olympiads, lead a state NGO, fundraised over $25,000, and worked on issues surrounding sustainability, access to high-quality education, and improving employment rates in my city (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/uttar-pradesh-city-moradabad-is-world-s-2nd-noisiest-city-delhi-kolkata-also-on-un-noise-pollution-list-101648348708558.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which is one of the most polluted and noisiest in the world</a>).
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            Interactions with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esatbayar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Esat Bayar</a> convinced me to apply to study abroad and helped me realise what I wish to do in the future.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            For now, I am at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bocconi University</a> and <a href="https://www.hec.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HEC Paris</a>, taking courses in Data Science, Government and History (I, still, mostly self-study). Being a first-generation student, I am very grateful to my Mom and Dad for giving me such an opportunity.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I adore the top-tier material world, playing pickleball and poker, teddy bears, travelling, making comedy films, forecasting future outcomes, and cooking for (and with) people I love.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I admire <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shah-rukh-khan-now-a-billionaire-bollywood-star-overtakes-taylor-swift-to-become-worlds-richest-entertainer-with-1-4-billion-net-worth/articleshow/124264124.cms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Lionel Messi, Novak Djokovic, <a href="https://herbertlui.net/sam-altman-on-self-belief-and-willfulness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sam Altman</a>, Naval Ravikant, a few sportswomen, female celebrities and female models.
